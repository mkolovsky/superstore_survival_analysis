This script performs various **business intelligence, exploratory data analysis (EDA), customer analytics, survival analysis, logistic regression modeling, and basket analysis** using the **Superstore dataset (2011-2015)**. Below is a breakdown of what each section does:

---

### **1. Setting Up & Data Loading**
- Sets the working directory and loads the **Superstore dataset** from a CSV file.
- Checks the structure, summary statistics, and column names of the dataset.

### **2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- Converts **Order Date and Ship Date** from strings to date format.
- Loads necessary libraries: `dplyr`, `lubridate`, `survival`, `survminer`, `ggplot2`, `arules`, `arulesViz`.

---

### **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Orders by Month:** Identifies which months have the highest order volume.
- **Cities with Most Discounts:** Counts discount usage per city.
- **Top 10% Most Profitable Customers & Their Purchases:**  
  - Identifies top customers by **profitability** and lists their **most purchased categories/products**.
- **Highest Order Volume by Country & Subcategory:** Finds which country has the most orders for a specific subcategory.
- **Average Shipping Time:** Computes the **average delivery duration** in days.
- **Cities with the Most Customers:** Counts unique customers per city.
- **Ranking Categories & Subcategories by Orders:** Sorts products from **most to least ordered**.
- **Returning Customers & Their Order Count:** Identifies **repeat buyers** and counts their orders.
- **Average Profit per Subcategory:** Computes **mean profit** per product subcategory.
- **Average Quantity per Order by State:** Finds **average quantity of items** purchased per order in **each U.S. state**.

---

### **4. Survival Analysis (Churn Prediction)**
- Uses **Kaplan-Meier estimation** to analyze customer retention.
- Defines **churn (customer dropout)** using **days since last purchase**.
- Computes **recency, frequency, and monetary (RFM) metrics** for customer segmentation.
- Implements a **Cox Proportional Hazards Model** to assess factors affecting customer churn.

---

### **5. Logistic Regression for Profitability Prediction**
- Converts `Profit` into a **binary outcome variable** (Profitable = 1, Not Profitable = 0).
- Trains a **logistic regression model** to predict profitability based on:
  - **Average profit per subcategory**
  - **Total sales**
  - **Total discount applied**
- Evaluates the model using **ROC Curve and AUC**.

---

### **6. Market Basket Analysis (Association Rules Mining)**
- Converts transaction data (`Order.ID`, `Sub.Category`) into a **market basket format**.
- Uses **Apriori algorithm** to find frequently bought together items.
- Generates **association rules** based on **support, confidence, and lift**.
- Visualizes the top association rules.

---

### **Key Insights You Can Extract from This Analysis**
- **Sales Trends:** Peak order months, most popular products, and customer purchasing behavior.
- **Profitability & Discounts:** Which **customers, cities, and product categories** contribute most to revenue.
- **Customer Behavior:** Identifies **repeat customers, churn trends, and factors affecting retention**.
- **Market Basket Insights:** Helps recommend **product bundling** or cross-selling strategies.

---

### **Suggested Improvements**
1. **Data Validation:** Check for missing values and potential data inconsistencies before analysis.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Introduce **new features (e.g., customer lifetime value, seasonality effects, time between purchases)**.
3. **Model Evaluation:** Perform **cross-validation** on the logistic regression model and improve feature selection.
4. **Advanced Machine Learning:** Consider using **random forests, XGBoost, or neural networks** for profitability prediction.
5. **Enhanced Basket Analysis:** Tune Apriori algorithm parameters for **stronger association rules**.
